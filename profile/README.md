# Math Quant Lab

Welcome to **Math Quant Lab** on GitHub! We are two students passionate about quantitative finance and applied mathematics, using this space to share our projects and interest in these fields.

## About Us

As students with a keen interest in finance and applied mathematics, we explore how Python can be utilized to tackle complex problems and perform advanced data analysis. This GitHub is our playground for experimenting, learning, and sharing our findings.

## Our Projects

Our projects range from quantitative financial analysis to applied mathematics applications, including the development of Python-based tools that can aid in our studies and research. Here are a few examples of what we're working on:

- **Market Analysis**: Exploring market data to extract quantitative insights.
- **Mathematical Models**: Applying applied mathematics principles to solve financial problems.
- **Programming Tools**: Creating scripts and tools in Python to automate our analyses and research.

## Technologies

We primarily use Python for our projects, leveraging libraries such as NumPy for numerical computing, Pandas for data manipulation, and Matplotlib for data visualization.

## Collaboration

While we are not actively looking for new members at the moment, we are open to collaborations on specific projects that align with our interests. If you have ideas or projects in mind that could benefit from our expertise, feel free to reach out to us.
